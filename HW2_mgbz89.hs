module HW2 where

-- Due: Wednesday, September 19, by 3pm.

-- Furthermore, everyone should adhere to the following guidelines to get full credit:

-- * Your submission must successfully load and typecheck in Haskell Platform to
-- get any points. For example, executing:
--      $ ghci HW2_pawprint.hs
-- should not produce any errors. We won't attempt to grade assignments that fail to load,
-- meaning you'll get zero points for this homework. Zero. Points.

-- * Name all functions and data types exactly as they appear in the
-- assignment. Grading will be partly automated, so incorrectly named functions are
-- likely to be counted as undefined functions.

-- * The code you submit must be your own. Exceptions: you may (of course) use
-- the code we provide however you like, including examples from the slides and the
-- books.

-- * No late submissions---PLEASE START EARLY!

-- For each of the following questions, put your answer directly below the
-- question.

-- (1) You must use a text editor (e.g., vi, textpad, emacs, etc.) to prepare
--     your solution.
-- (2) You must write type declarations for each and every one of your Haskell
--     definitions.
-- (3) The program you turn in must be the product of your effort alone.

-- There are ten questions, each worth 10 points, making this homework
-- worth 100 points total. Some are harder than others.


-- 1. Fill in the gaps. Complete the following definitions. It does not
--    matter what the definitions do as long as they are type correct. For e1, e2,
--    e5, and e7, this means uncommenting the type declaration and replacing the ? with
--    type(s) correspond to the definitions directly below them. For e3, e4,
--    e6, and e8, this means replacing the undefined with an expression of appropriate type.
--
--    Note: you should complete each definition one at a time.

e1 :: [Bool]
e1 = [True,False,True]

e2 :: [[Integer]]
e2 = [[1,2],[3,4]]

e3 :: (Char,Bool)
e3 = ('a', True)

e4 :: [(String,Int)]
e4 = [("hello", 5), ("bye", 2)]

e5 :: Num a => a -> a
e5 n = n*2

e6 :: Int -> Int -> Int
e6 n e = n * e

e7 :: (a, b) -> (b, a)
e7 (x,y) = (y,x)

e8 :: a -> (a,a)
e8 n = (n, n)

-- 2. Add type declarations to the following definitions. Try to give the most general types possible.

nums :: [Int]
nums = [1,2,3,4,5]

table :: [(Bool, Int)]
table = [(False,1),(True,2),(False,3)]

one :: a -> [a]
one x = [x]

three :: a -> (a, a, a)
three x = (x,x,x)

first :: a -> b -> a
first x y = x

mult :: Num a => a -> a -> a
mult m n = m * n

-- 3. The function, second :: [a] -> a, returns the second element in a list that contains at least
--    this many elements. Define three different versions of this function using:
-- (a) head and tail
-- (b) list indexing !!
-- (c) pattern matching
--
-- Name your functions second1, second2 and second3 and define them below.

second1 :: [a] -> a
-- second1 [] = error "Empty List"
-- second1 x = error "Only one element"
second1 (x:xs) = head xs

second2 :: [a] -> a
-- second2 [] = error "Empty List"
-- second2 x = error "Only one element"
second2 (x:xs) = xs !! 0

second3 :: [a] -> a
-- second3 [] = error "Empty List"
-- second3 x = error "Only one element"
second3 (_:y:_) = y

-- 4. The exclusive-or function, xor :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool, takes two Bool values and returns
--    True when precisely one is True, returning False otherwise. Define three versions of this
--    function using:
-- (a) pattern matching
-- (b) if then else
-- (c) the operator /= (not equal to)
--
-- Name your functions xor1, xor2 and xor3. Make your definitions as simple as possible.

xor1 :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
xor1 True True = False
xor1 True False = True
xor1 False True = True
xor1 False False = False

xor2 :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
xor2 x y =  if x == y
              then False
            else True

xor3 :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
xor3 x y = x /= y

-- 5. Using a list comprehension, define a function, sumsqr :: Int -> Int, that calculates
--    the sum of the first n integer squares. For example, sumsqr 3 = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 14. You
--    may assume that n >= 0.

sumsqr :: Int -> Int
sumsqr x = sum [x^2 | x <- [1..x]]

--6. Using a list comprehension, define a function grid :: Int -> [(Int,Int)] that returns a
--   list of all (x, y) coordinate pairs on an n X n square grid, excluding the diagonal
--   running from (0, 0) to (n, n). For example,
--
--     ghci> grid 2
--        [(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,2),(2,0),(2,1)]

grid :: Int -> [(Int, Int)]
grid x = [(a, b) | a <- [0..x], b <- [0..x], a /= b]



-- 7. Define the function snoc :: a -> [a] -> [a], which takes an item and a list of items as
--    input, and returns the list with the item at the end. For example:
--        ghci> snoc 9 [1,2,3,4]
--           [1,2,3,4,9]
--
--    Notice that snoc puts an item at the end of a list and not at the head like cons.
--    To receive credit, you cannot use append (++) â€“ you must use recursion and cons (:) only.
--
snoc :: a -> [a] -> [a]
snoc y []     = [y]
snoc y (x:xs) = x : snoc y xs

-- 8. Consider the following definition of list reversal:
--
rev :: [a] -> [a]
rev xs = rev' [] xs
   where rev' :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]
         rev' acc []     = acc
         rev' acc (x:xs) = rev' (x:acc) xs

-- The helper function rev' an example of "accumulator passing style" (APS). With APS, an
-- intermediate value is passed along (a.k.a., "accumulated"). For reasons we will discuss in
-- class, APS can be, in some circumstances, a much more efficient style than the naive way
-- we have written reverse in class.

-- Write a function, maxaps, that, when given a list of non-negative Int's, returns the maximum
-- number in the list.

maxaps :: Ord a => [a] -> a
maxaps [] = error "Empty List"
maxaps (x:xs) = maxaps' xs x
    where maxaps' :: Ord a => [a] -> a -> a
          maxaps' [] acc     = acc
          maxaps' (x:xs) acc = if(x < acc)
                                  then maxaps' xs acc
                                  else maxaps' xs x
-- 9. Write a function, sumaps, which calculates the sum of a list on Int's in accumulator passing
--    style.

sumaps :: Num a => [a] -> a
sumaps xs = sumaps' xs 0
    where sumaps' :: Num a => [a] -> a -> a
          sumaps' [] acc     = acc
          sumaps' (x:xs) acc = sumaps' xs (x + acc)

--
-- -- 10. Recall the usual factorial function definition:
-- --
-- fac 0 = 1
-- fac n = n * fac (n-1)

-- Write a function, facaps, that calculates factorial in accumulator passing style.

facaps :: Int -> Int
facaps x = facaps' x 1
    where facaps' :: Int -> Int -> Int
          facaps' 0 acc = acc
          facaps' x acc = facaps' (x - 1) (acc * x)
